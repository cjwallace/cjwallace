**Hello. I am Chris, and I make h̷̶̷̶ͪi̷̶̷̶ͥg̷̶h̷̶̷̶ͪ q̷̶u̷̶̷̶ͧa̷̶̷̶ͣl̷̶i̷̶̷̶ͥᴛ̷̶̷̶ⷮy̷̶ s̷̶͛o̷̶̷̶ͦf̷̶ᴛ̷̶̷̶ⷮw̷̶a̷̶̷̶ͣr̷̶̷̶ͬe̷̶̷̶ͤ things with computers.**

I'm a data scientist, software engineer, and human on the internet. I'm charting roughly the opposite course to the popular one: I became a data scientist, discovered a love of building things, and now gravitate towards software design and development.

You can read [posts](https://standard.dev/details) I have written, and use [software](https://standard.dev/software) I have made.

I don't [tweet](https://twitter.com/_cjwallace) much, but if we haven't met, it's a good way to say hi.

✌️
