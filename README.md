### Hi 👋

### I'm Chris, and I make things with computers.

I'm a data scientist, software engineer, and human on the internet. I've been charting roughly the opposite course to the popular one: I set out to be a data scientist, discovered a love of building things, and increasingly gravitate towards software design and development. I like making technology work for people, never vice versa.

Until recently, I lead machine learning research engineering at [Fast Forward Labs](https://github.com/fastforwardlabs). Right now, I'm at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com).

You can read things I've written over at [standard.dev](https://standard.dev). I don't [tweet](https://twitter.com/_cjwallace) much, but if we haven't met, it's the best way to say hi ✌️
