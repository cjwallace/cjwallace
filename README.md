**Hello. I am Chris, and I make h̷̶̷̶ͪi̷̶̷̶ͥg̷̶h̷̶̷̶ͪ q̷̶u̷̶̷̶ͧa̷̶̷̶ͣl̷̶i̷̶̷̶ͥᴛ̷̶̷̶ⷮy̷̶ s̷̶͛o̷̶̷̶ͦf̷̶ᴛ̷̶̷̶ⷮw̷̶a̷̶̷̶ͣr̷̶̷̶ͬe̷̶̷̶ͤ things with computers.**

I'm a software engineer and human on the internet. I'm charting roughly the opposite course to the popular one: I became a data scientist, discovered that [making things is deep magick](https://standard.dev/details/making-things-is-deep-magick), and now gravitate towards software design and development.

You can read [posts](https://standard.dev/posts) I have written, and use [software](https://standard.dev/software) I have made.

I don't post much on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/standard.dev).
