### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist and software engineer who likes building data products and making technology work for people, never vice versa.
I care about software quality and responsible data science.

Right now, I lead machine learning research engineering at [Fast Forward Labs](https://github.com/fastforwardlabs).
